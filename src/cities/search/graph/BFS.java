    /**Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
     It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'source node'),
     and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

     Here's how BFS works:

     - Initialization: Mark all nodes as not visited. Create an empty queue and enqueue the source vertex (node) into it.
        Mark this node as visited.

     - Traversal: While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:
        Dequeue a vertex from the queue. Let's say the dequeued vertex is v. Print v or process it based on your goal.
        Enqueue all unvisited neighbors of v and mark them as visited.

     - Completion: The algorithm ends when every node that can be reached from the source node has been visited.

     BFS uses the adjacency matrix or adjacency list representation of a graph.
     The main advantage of BFS is that it can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.

     In terms of time complexity, BFS will visit each vertex once and each edge once, leading to a time complexity of O(V+E),
     where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

     One of the key characteristics of BFS is that it provides a complete searchâ€”it is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists,
     even if it has to search the entire graph. The solution found by BFS is also guaranteed to be the shortest in terms of the
     number of steps, but not necessarily in terms of the path cost.

     BFS is often contrasted with depth-first search (DFS). While BFS explores neighbors first and thus is excellent
     for searching at a shallow level, DFS goes deep into a graph, exploring a path as far as possible before backtracking,
     which can be useful when the search space is large and solutions are dense but located deep in the graph.*/
